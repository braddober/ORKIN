######### THIS FILE INCLUDES INSTRUCTIONS FOR TUNING THE MUSTANG UMUXes AND/OR STARTING DEMOD DATA###################

To start DEMOD DATA ONLY (ie. just stream junk data):

To start initialize the ROAChes AND start demod data: 
   1.First turn on the ROACHes, HEMTs, and DS345 function generator using the iBoot bar. 
   2. Then run "start_demod.py" in ipython from the umuxsvn 
      	   (NOTE this must be done on egret or 
      	   the function generator will not start).
   3. The function you need is called "initroaches" and requires two keywords: 
      a. "rootlist": list of paths to ROACHIP file of each ROACH you want to initialize 
      b. "freqFile" which should point to any old copy of default_freqs.txt. 
      	 There is one available in the svn called "mux1_tuned_freqs_ref.txt". 

####EXAMPLE OF HOW TO INITIALIZE ALL 4 ROACHES FROM lmonctrl:~/umuxsvn:#####
	from start_demod import initroaches
	p = '/home/scratch/bmason/m2scr'
	rl = ['%s/roach%d' % (p,i) for i in [1,2,3,4]]
	um = initroaches(rootlist = rl, freqFile = "mux1_tuned_freqs_ref.txt")

Once this is complete: the funciton generator will be on, running at 1kHz, 0.249V, and all 4 ROACHes will be streaming demod data, this is all you need if you just want to perform health checks such as checking PingPong, frame counters, etc.


To FULLY TUNE THE SYSTEM:

Once again running ipython from the lmonctrl:~/umuxsvn: The python script to use is "multitune.py".

1. First ensure the ROACHes, HEMTs, and DS345 are all ON in the iBoot Ba  
2. To initialize the ROACHes you once again run "initroaches":
    however this version requires only a rootdir list and WILL NOT start demod data, it will only instantiate the umux classes.
3. Once finished you will have 4 umux classes, eg. ums[i] each of which is the instantiation of a single ROACH. 
   The ROACHes often come up in different orders so be careful not to assume ums[0]=roach1,
   the will be a statement printed saying "ums[i] is mustangr1-II"
4. Currently attenuation for muxes 1 and 4 must be specified by hand (I will change this soon) so for now once you figure out which index coresponds to ROACHes/muxes 1 & 4, and set um.progAttens(18,0). 
5. The run multtiune. See example below:

   ##EXAMPLE OF HOW TO RUN MULTITUNE####
	from multitune import initroaches, multitune, startDemod
	rootlist=['/home/scratch/bmason/m2scr/roach1/','/home/scratch/bmason/m2scr/roach2/','/home/scratch/bmason/m2scr/roach3/','/home/scratch/bmason/m2scr/roach4/']
	ums=initroaches(rootlist)
	ums[***mux1***].progAttens(18,0)
	ums[***mux4***].progAttens(18,0)
	multitune(ums)
 This will tune all the muxes in the input list ums, the proper save directory in /home/scratch/sstanchf/M2_tunings will automatically be created
      	  FEB 26: RIGHT NOW IT ONLY SAVES IN A FOLDER SPECIFIED BY DATE, 
	  SO RUNNING TWICE IN ONE DAY WILL OVERWRITE YOUR PREVIOUS TUNING PLOTS
	   FOR ANY ROACH THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TUNED THAT DAY....SARA IS FIXING THIS ASAP!!!!

6. Then you can proceed to start demod using startDemod:
   #### EXAMPLE OF HOW TO START DEMOD #######
   	startDemod(ums,1000,0.249)
7. All ROACHes in ums should be streaming demod data
